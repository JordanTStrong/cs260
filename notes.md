This is where my notes will go. 
This assignment was actually really fun. I have used Git a little bit at work, but very infrequently, so it is fun to 
have the chance to practice and gain experience with file manipulation within git. 

KEY GIT COMMANDS:
git pull -- pulls a branch
git add -- 'stages' a change for commit
git commit -m "message here" -- Commits the changes
git push <branch-name> -- Pushes the changes to GitHub
