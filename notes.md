This is where my notes will go. 
This assignment was actually really fun. I have used Git a little bit at work, but very infrequently, so it is fun to 
have the chance to practice and gain experience with file manipulation within git. 

KEY GIT COMMANDS:
git pull -- pulls a branch
git add -- 'stages' a change for commit
git commit -m "message here" -- Commits the changes
git push <branch-name> -- Pushes the changes to GitHub

						CLASS 5/11 -- CSS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- CSS is for styling
- ; separates statements 
- 3 ways to overlay css
	1) InLine style 
		```
		<body>				 )
		<p style="color:red">css</p>     >   <--- this whole thing is called a rule set. Things like "color", "font size", etc are declarations
		</body>				 )		
		```
	- This isn't used very much
	- Inline style overrides anything above it

	2) Multiline Style
	
	3) Separate styles file

- Any HTML that is a <div> type will auto apply any setttings in <div>



- Text design
	- called an "em" because of typography practices back in the day. Where x is an int, xem means take the em size and multiply it by x
	- Box Model
		- margin outermost
		- border inside margin
		- padding inside border
		- content inside padding

- CSS doesn't create any new parts of the website, it just modifies and stylizes the already-written HTML
- Selectors are used to identify specific pieces to style
- Declarations are the parts of selectors that actually modify the site

- When I see something like p{} or div{} that is setting a default style for any p or div elements found in the HTML doc
- <div>, like <p>, groups things together without creating a new paragraph like <p>
