STARTUP SPECS:

Elevator Pitch:
	How many times have you gone to the grocery store this year? How about this month? How 
many times did you find yourself wishing you had a list on your phone you could continually 
refer to so you could save yourself from listing all your groceries for each visit? With Prept, you 
only have to list out your groceries once! Then, let Prept do the tedious work of remembering your 
purchases. Oh, and did we mention you can do it all via barcode scanning?
